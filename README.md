# deusto-dual-folders

The repository contains 3 different scripts:
- `students_folder_creation.py`: scans a CSV cotaing basic information of students (name, course) and it creates all the folders and files structure needed for the student dual tutors.
- `filenames_checker.py`: scans every file in the folders of the dual students and verifies that they follow correct naming patterns.
- `students_folder_checker.py`: scans students folders and checks that all the basic files (with valid filenames) had been created.

### Prerequisites
In order to run the scripts input data must be provided (you can configure data paths from configuration files) and `/logs` folder must be created.
